# OIA-Text-Search-Methods

# Overview

This package documents the methods used by the Tennessee Department of Health 
to identify drug overdose deaths by performing literal text search on the death certificates 'Cause of Death' text fields.
Currently, the TDH Overdose Surveillance Program utilizes this method to count provisional deaths and
proactively identify deaths involving substances unable to be captured with ICD-10 codes.
